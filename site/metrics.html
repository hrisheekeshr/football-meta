            <h2>Understanding the Numbers</h2>
            <p>Each metric provides insight into a player's performance but has limitations to consider. Below are brief explanations of some common statistics.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Completion Percentage:</strong> Measures a quarterback's accuracy, but can be inflated by short passes.</li>
                <li><strong>Yards After Catch:</strong> Highlights a receiver's ability to gain extra yards, though often influenced by play design.</li>
                <li><strong>Passer Rating Allowed:</strong> Gauges defensive backs, but doesn't fully account for defensive schemes.</li>
                <li><strong>Tackles:</strong> Simple to tally, yet doesn't differentiate between impactful plays and routine stops.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Context is key with any metric. Combine data points and consider game situations to form a complete picture.</p>
