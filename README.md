# Football Meta

This repository contains a basic static website that explains various football metrics. The site includes three pages:

1. **Landing page** (`index.html`) – introduces the purpose of the site.
2. **Positions & Metrics** (`positions.html`) – lists common football positions along with example metrics.
3. **Metric Details** (`metrics.html`) – provides additional context about how to interpret the metrics.

All website files are located in the `site/` directory. To view the site locally, open `site/index.html` in your browser.
